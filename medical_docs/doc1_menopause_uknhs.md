You can also speak to a pharmacist for advice about treatments and things you can do.

How long symptoms last
----------------------

Symptoms can last for months or years, and can change with time.

For example, hot flashes and night sweats may improve, and then you may develop low mood and anxiety.

Some symptoms, such as joint pain and vaginal dryness, can carry on after your periods stop.

### Important: Get help for symptoms

Getting advice early can help reduce the impact perimenopause and menopause have on your health, relationships and work.

Menopause and perimenopause if you’re using hormonal contraception
-------------------------------------------------------------

You cannot know for sure you've reached menopause if you're using hormonal contraception like the pill, IUS (hormonal coil), contraceptive implant or contraceptive injection. This is because hormonal contraception can affect your periods.

If you're taking the combined pill, you'll have monthly period-type bleeds for as long as you keep taking the pill.

The combined pill may also mask or control menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats.

If you use the progestogen-only pill, IUS, contraceptive implant or contraceptive injection, your bleeds may be irregular or stop completely for as long as you use this contraception.

This can make it hard to know when you're no longer ovulating and therefore no longer fertile.

### Stopping contraception

You can stop using contraception at the age of 55, as getting pregnant naturally after this is very rare.

You’ll be advised not to take the combined pill from the age of 50. You can change to a progestogen-only pill or other method of contraception instead.

# Menopause - Treatment

Treatment for menopause and perimenopause
-----------------------------------------

The main medicine treatment for menopause and perimenopause symptoms is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which replaces the hormones that are at low levels.

There are other treatments if you cannot, or choose not to, have HRT.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
---------------------------------

HRT is a safe and effective treatment for most going through menopause and perimenopause. Your Medic will discuss any risks with you.

HRT involves using estrogen to replace your body's own levels around the time of the menopause.

There are different types and doses of HRT. Using the right dose and type usually means your symptoms improve.

Estrogen comes as:

*   skin patches
*   a gel or spray to put on the skin
*   implants
*   tablets

If you have a womb (uterus) you also need to take progesterone to protect your womb lining from the effects of estrogen. Taking estrogen and progesterone is called combined HRT.

Progesterone comes as:

*   patches, as part of a combined patch with estrogen
*   IUS (intrauterine system, or coil)
*   tablets

If you have low sex drive because of menopause and HRT does not improve it, you may be offered testosterone.

### Benefits of HRT

The main benefit of HRT is that it can help relieve most menopause and perimenopause symptoms, including hot flashes, brain fog, joint pains, mood swings and vaginal dryness.

Hot flashes or night sweats often improve within a few weeks. Other symptoms like mood changes and vaginal dryness can take a few months to improve.

Taking HRT can also reduce your risk of hormone-related health problems including osteoporosis and heart disease.

### Risks of HRT

The risks of HRT are small and usually outweighed by the benefits.

If you're interested in HRT, your doctor or nurse can discuss the risks with you.

### How long to take HRT

Before you start taking HRT for menopause and perimenopause symptoms, a healthcare professional will usually talk to you about how long you may need it for.

If you stop taking HRT, your symptoms may come back. But you can usually start taking it again if you want to.

If you have any questions about this, ask a healthcare professional for advice.


Testosterone gel for reduced sex drive
--------------------------------------

If HRT does not help restore your sex drive, you might be offered a testosterone gel or cream. It can help improve sex drive, mood and energy levels.

Testosterone is produced by the ovaries and your levels usually get lower with age.

It's not currently licensed for use in women, although it can be prescribed after the menopause by a specialist doctor if they think it might help restore your sex drive.

You can safely use this at the same time as HRT.

Side effects of using testosterone are not common but include acne and unwanted hair growth.

Testosterone gel or cream can also cause side effects in others if they come into contact with it regularly. To avoid this, wash your hands after using it and cover the area with clothing.



Estrogen for vaginal dryness and discomfort
--------------------------------------------

Your vagina may become dry, painful or itchy as a result of the menopause and perimenopause.

Your medic can prescribe [estrogen treatments you can insert into your vagina], as a tablet, cream or ring. This can also improve any urinary symptoms caused by menopause and perimenopause, like pain when you pee.

These vaginal estrogen treatments do not get into your bloodstream and only work on the bit of the body where you put them. You can use them for the rest of your life. Symptoms usually come back when you stop using them.

It's safe to use vaginal estrogen with HRT.


Non-hormone medicines
---------------------

There are non-hormone treatments if your symptoms are having a big impact on your life and you cannot, or choose not to, have HRT.

### Hot flashes and night sweats

There are some medicines that can help with hot flashes and night sweats.

These include:

*   a blood pressure medicine called [clonidine]
*   an epilepsy medicine called [gabapentin]

Always Talk with a medic about these medicines and their side effects, and if they might be suitable for you.

### Mood symptoms

Antidepressants can help with mood symptoms if you've been diagnosed with depression or anxiety.

### Vaginal dryness

You can use non-hormonal treatments such as vaginal moisturizers if you have vaginal dryness caused by menopause and perimenopause.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy which can help with:

*   low mood and anxiety caused by menopause and perimenopause
*   some physical symptoms like hot flashes and joint pain
*   sleep problems


Follow-up appointments
----------------------

If you're having treatment for your symptoms of menopause or perimenopause, you'll need to return to the doctor or nurse who is prescribing your HRT for a follow-up review after 3 months.

When you and your doctor or nurse agree your treatment is working well for you, you'll need to see them once a year.

During your reviews, your doctor or nurse may:

*   make sure your symptoms are under control
*   ask about any side effects and vaginal bleeding
*   check your weight and blood pressure
*   review the type of HRT you're taking and make any necessary changes

You may need treatment for a few years, until most of your menopause and perimenopause symptoms have passed.

You can choose to continue taking HRT. The doctor or nurse prescribing your HRT can discuss with you the benefits and risks, so you can decide what’s right for you.

You can take HRT for as long as you need it. You can discuss this with your doctor or nurse at your yearly review.

Complementary and alternative therapies
---------------------------------------

Complementary and alternative treatments, such as herbal remedies and compounded bioidentical ("natural") hormones, are not recommended for symptoms of the menopause or perimenopause.

This is because it's not clear how safe and effective they are.

Red clover and black cohosh are herbal remedies but there is no strong evidence that they work.

Some complementary and alternative therapies can also interact with other medicines and cause side effects.

Ask your Medic or pharmacist for advice if you're thinking about using a complementary therapy.

### Compounded bioidentical hormones

Compounded bioidentical hormones are sometimes offered in private clinics as HRT. They are not recommended because it's not known how well they work or how safe they are. They are not available on the NHS.

They are different from regulated bioidentical hormones, also called body identical hormones.

Bioidentical hormones are available on the NHS as HRT. They have been tested to see how well they work and how safe they are.
