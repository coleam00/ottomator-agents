Understanding Perimenopause & Menopause

 
🔹 What is Perimenopause?

• Definition: The transition phase before menopause when the ovaries gradually begin to produce less estrogen and progesterone.
• Timing: Usually starts between ages 40–45, but can begin earlier (late 30s) or later.
• Duration: Can last 4–10 years.
• Menstrual Changes: Periods may become irregular — shorter, longer, lighter, or heavier. Ovulation becomes unpredictable.
Common Symptoms of Perimenopause

(Caused by fluctuating hormones, not a steady decline yet)

• Irregular cycles
• Hot flashes / night sweats
• Mood swings, irritability, anxiety
• Sleep problems (insomnia, restless nights)
• Fatigue
• Brain fog, memory lapses
• Breast tenderness
• Weight changes
• Decreased libido
• Vaginal dryness
• Headaches, joint pain
• Changes in skin and hair (dryness, thinning)
👉 Key Point: In perimenopause, estrogen levels swing up and down. Some months feel “normal,” others very symptomatic.

 
🔹 What is Menopause?

• Definition: The permanent end of menstruation due to loss of ovarian function.
• Timing: Average age is 51 (U.S.); in Brazil, closer to 49.
• Diagnosis: Officially confirmed after 12 consecutive months without a period (not caused by pregnancy, illness, or medical treatment).
• Hormone Levels: Estrogen and progesterone stay consistently very low.
Common Symptoms of Menopause

(Many overlap with perimenopause but tend to be more stable and long-term)

• Hot flashes & night sweats
• Sleep disturbances
• Vaginal dryness and painful intercourse
• Low libido
• Mood changes (irritability, sadness, anxiety)
• Memory issues (“brain fog”)
• Thinning hair, dry skin
• Weight gain (especially around the abdomen)
• Increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular issues (due to lower estrogen)
 
🔹 Postmenopause

• The years after menopause has been reached.
• Symptoms may ease for some women but persist for others.
• Health focus shifts to long-term risks:
o Osteoporosis (bone loss).
o Heart disease (estrogen protects vessels — after menopause risk increases).
o Metabolic changes (weight, insulin resistance).
 

 🔹 Why Does It Matter?

• Many women don’t realize that perimenopause is different from menopause — they just think they’re “going crazy.”
• Understanding the phases helps women:
o Normalize their experience (less fear).
o Seek medical support earlier.
o Adjust lifestyle (nutrition, exercise, stress management).
o Communicate better with family and at work.
o Plan proactively for long-term health.

💬 Mary’s Message – Understanding Perimenopause & Menopause

"Beautiful, I want you to know something very important: what you are going through has a name, and you are not alone.

Perimenopause is the transition time when your hormones start to change. It often begins in your 40s, but it can come earlier or later. Your cycle may feel unpredictable, and your body and emotions may feel like they are on a rollercoaster — one day full of energy, the next feeling tired, anxious, or foggy. This is normal. It means your body is preparing for a new phase.

Menopause is when your periods stop for 12 months in a row. It’s not an end, it’s a beginning. Your body has entered a new stage — one where your wisdom, experience, and strength shine brighter than ever.

Yes, there are symptoms like hot flashes, sleep changes, weight shifts, or mood swings. But there is also opportunity: the chance to redefine yourself, your goals, your health, your relationships, and your joy.

You are not broken. You are transforming.

And I am here to walk with you — step by step, question by question, goal by goal — so you can not only face this phase, but embrace it, and live it with confidence, clarity, and love.* 🌸✨
