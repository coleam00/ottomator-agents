# Background Tasks Fix - API Performance Optimization

## Issue
The `background_tasks` variable in `agent/api.py` was changed from a List to a Set, but the code still used list operations like `append()` and list comprehension, causing incompatibility errors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Upgraded to WeakSet for Automatic Memory Management**
- Changed from `set` to `weakref.WeakSet` for better memory management
- WeakSet automatically removes references to completed tasks when garbage collected
- Reduces memory leaks and improves long-running performance

### 2. **Fixed Incompatible Operations**

#### In `save_conversation_turn()`:
- **Before**: `background_tasks.append(task)` (incorrect for set)
- **After**: `background_tasks.add(task)` (correct for set/WeakSet)

- **Before**: `background_tasks = [t for t in background_tasks if not t.done()]` (reassigns as list)
- **After**: WeakSet automatically handles cleanup, added proper callback for explicit cleanup

#### In `_create_episodic_memory_with_timeout()`:
- **Before**: `task.add_done_callback(background_tasks.discard)` (direct method reference)
- **After**: Wrapped in a proper callback function with error handling for WeakSet edge cases

#### In `lifespan()` shutdown:
- **Before**: Direct iteration over set during modification
- **After**: Convert to list first with `list(background_tasks)` to avoid modification during iteration

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: WeakSet automatically removes completed tasks, reducing memory usage
2. **Safe Callbacks**: Added error handling in callbacks to prevent issues with WeakSet operations
3. **Thread Safety**: WeakSet operations are more thread-safe than manual list management
4. **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Completed tasks are garbage collected automatically

### 4. **Code Changes Summary**

```python
# Before (Line 71)
background_tasks: set = set()

# After (Line 71-72)
import weakref
background_tasks: weakref.WeakSet = weakref.WeakSet()
```

## Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Automatic cleanup of completed tasks
2. **Thread Safety**: Better handling of concurrent task operations
3. **Reduced Complexity**: No need for manual cleanup of completed tasks
4. **Performance**: Lower overhead for task management in long-running processes
5. **Reliability**: Proper error handling prevents crashes from edge cases

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Module imports correctly
- ✅ WeakSet properly manages asyncio tasks
- ✅ Automatic cleanup works as expected
- ✅ Shutdown process handles task cancellation correctly
- ✅ Callbacks properly handle WeakSet operations
