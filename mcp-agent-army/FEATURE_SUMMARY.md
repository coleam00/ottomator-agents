# Dynamic Model Selection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a dynamic model selection feature for the MCP Agent Army that allows the system to automatically choose the most appropriate OpenAI model based on the complexity of the user's request, estimated token usage, and budget considerations.

## Key Changes

1. **Modified the `get_model()` function** to accept an optional model name override:
   - Added parameter `model_name` to allow specifying a different model
   - Default still uses the MODEL_CHOICE environment variable

2. **Created a model selection agent**:
   - Uses gpt-3.5-turbo by default to minimize cost
   - Specialized system prompt for analyzing query complexity, token usage, and context requirements
   - Returns a JSON response with model choice and rephrased query

3. **Implemented a model selection function**:
   - `select_model_for_task()` - Analyzes user input and selects the best model
   - Optimizes/rephrases the query for the selected model with token efficiency in mind
   - Has fallback mechanism if model selection fails

4. **Added command-line interface for model selection**:
   - `enable auto model` - Enables dynamic model selection
   - `disable auto model` - Disables dynamic model selection
   - Flag to track when the feature is enabled

5. **Modified the main user interaction loop**:
   - When enabled, selects model before processing
   - Displays selected model and rephrased query to user
   - Resets model to default after processing

6. **Updated Studio Integration**:
   - Added model selection to API endpoint
   - Added toggle endpoint for enabling/disabling feature per session
   - Extended response model to include model selection metadata

7. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added feature description to README.md files
   - Created dedicated README for studio integration version
   - Documented API endpoints for the feature

## Model Selection Criteria

The system chooses between three OpenAI models based on:
- Query complexity
- Estimated token usage 
- Context length requirements
- Budget considerations

Specific model selection guidelines:

- **gpt-3.5-turbo**: For simple queries, factual questions, and basic tasks (under 1000 tokens) - most budget-friendly
- **gpt-4o-mini**: For medium-complexity tasks (1000-2000 tokens) requiring good balance of performance and cost
- **gpt-4o**: For complex reasoning, creative tasks, detailed analysis, or lengthy outputs (over 2000 tokens) - used only when necessary due to higher cost

## Benefits

- **Cost Optimization**: Uses less expensive models for simpler tasks, with explicit token usage considerations
- **Performance Improvement**: Uses more capable models only when necessary
- **Query Optimization**: Rephrases queries to be more token-efficient for the chosen model
- **Flexibility**: Can be enabled/disabled by the user or per API request
- **Budget Efficiency**: Explicitly prioritizes cost-effective choices while maintaining quality
