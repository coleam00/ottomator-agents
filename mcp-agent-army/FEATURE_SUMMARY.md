# Dynamic Model Selection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a dynamic model selection feature for the MCP Agent Army that allows the system to automatically choose the most appropriate OpenAI model based on the complexity of the user's request.

## Key Changes

1. **Modified the `get_model()` function** to accept an optional model name override:
   - Added parameter `model_name` to allow specifying a different model
   - Default still uses the MODEL_CHOICE environment variable

2. **Created a model selection agent**:
   - Uses gpt-3.5-turbo by default to minimize cost
   - Specialized system prompt for analyzing query complexity
   - Returns a JSON response with model choice and rephrased query

3. **Implemented a model selection function**:
   - `select_model_for_task()` - Analyzes user input and selects the best model
   - Also optimizes/rephrases the query for the selected model
   - Has fallback mechanism if model selection fails

4. **Added command-line interface for model selection**:
   - `enable auto model` - Enables dynamic model selection
   - `disable auto model` - Disables dynamic model selection
   - Flag to track when the feature is enabled

5. **Modified the main user interaction loop**:
   - When enabled, selects model before processing
   - Displays selected model and rephrased query to user
   - Resets model to default after processing

6. **Updated Studio Integration**:
   - Added model selection to API endpoint
   - Added toggle endpoint for enabling/disabling feature per session
   - Extended response model to include model selection metadata

7. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added feature description to README.md files
   - Created dedicated README for studio integration version
   - Documented API endpoints for the feature

## Model Selection Criteria

The system chooses between three OpenAI models based on query complexity:

- **gpt-3.5-turbo**: For simple queries, factual questions, and basic tasks
- **gpt-4o-mini**: For medium-complexity tasks requiring good balance of performance and cost
- **gpt-4o**: For complex reasoning, creative tasks, and detailed analysis

## Benefits

- **Cost Optimization**: Uses less expensive models for simpler tasks
- **Performance Improvement**: Uses more capable models when necessary
- **Query Optimization**: Rephrases queries to be more effective for the chosen model
- **Flexibility**: Can be enabled/disabled by the user or per API request
