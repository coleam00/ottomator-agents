# Neo4j User Isolation Implementation - Complete

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Implementation**: Successfully using Graphiti's native `group_id` feature for user isolation

## Overview

The Neo4j user isolation has been successfully implemented using Graphiti's built-in `group_id` parameter for graph partitioning. This ensures complete separation of user conversations while maintaining a shared medical knowledge base.

## Architecture

### Data Partitioning Strategy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Neo4j Graph Database          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Shared Knowledge (group_id="0")   │
│  - Medical documents                │
│  - Research papers                  │
│  - General health information       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  User 1 (group_id=UUID1)           │
│  - Personal conversations           │
│  - Individual symptoms              │
│  - Private health journey           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  User 2 (group_id=UUID2)           │
│  - Personal conversations           │
│  - Individual symptoms              │
│  - Private health journey           │

## Implementation Details

### 1. System Prompt Updates (`agent/prompts.py`)
- Added clear distinction between shared and user-specific data sources
- Explained when to use each type of search
- Emphasized privacy and isolation of user data

### 2. Ingestion Updates (`ingestion/graph_builder.py`)
- Modified to use `group_id="0"` for shared knowledge base documents
- All medical documentation is stored in the shared partition
- Added metadata flag `knowledge_type: "shared"` for clarity

### 3. Graph Utils Updates (`agent/graph_utils.py`)
- Added `group_id` parameter to `add_episode()` method
- Added `group_ids` filter parameter to `search()` method
- Properly passes group_id to Graphiti's native methods
- No custom user management methods needed

### 4. Episodic Memory Updates (`agent/episodic_memory.py`)
- Extracts `user_id` from metadata
- Passes `user_id` as `group_id` when creating episodes
- Filters searches by user's `group_id` for isolation
- Symptom timelines also isolated by user

### 5. Agent Tools Updates (`agent/tools.py`)
- Graph search defaults to shared knowledge (`group_id="0"`)
- Episodic memory search uses user's `group_id`
- Combined searches can access both shared and user-specific data

### 6. Agent Updates (`agent/agent.py`)
- Graph search tool explicitly searches shared knowledge base
- Episodic memory tool uses user context for isolation
- Proper routing based on data source

## Key Features

### ✅ Complete User Isolation
- Each user's conversations are stored with their UUID as `group_id`
- Searches are filtered by `group_id` to prevent cross-user access
- Users cannot see each other's personal health information

### ✅ Shared Knowledge Base
- Medical documents stored with `group_id="0"`
- All users can access general medical information
- Maintains single source of truth for medical knowledge

### ✅ Flexible Search Capabilities
- Can search only shared knowledge: `group_ids=["0"]`
- Can search only user data: `group_ids=[user_uuid]`
- Can search both: `group_ids=["0", user_uuid]`

## Test Results

```bash
python tests/test_user_isolation_fixed.py
```

### Test Summary:
- ✅ Shared knowledge accessible to all users
- ✅ User 1 cannot see User 2's conversations
- ✅ User 2 cannot see User 1's conversations
- ✅ Combined searches work correctly
- ✅ Complete isolation verified

## API Usage

### Creating User-Specific Episodes
```python
await graph_client.add_episode(
    episode_id="conversation_123",
    content="User's health concern",
    source="conversation",
    group_id=user_uuid  # User's Supabase UUID
)
```

### Searching User's Data
```python
# Search only user's conversations
results = await graph_client.search(
    query="symptoms",
    group_ids=[user_uuid]
)

# Search shared + user's data
results = await graph_client.search(
    query="menopause treatments",
    group_ids=["0", user_uuid]
)
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

### 1. **Simplicity**
- Uses Graphiti's native features
- No custom user management code
- Clean, maintainable solution

### 2. **Security**
- Complete data isolation at graph level
- No possibility of accidental cross-user access
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Performance**
- Efficient filtering by indexed `group_id`
- No additional queries needed
- Scalable to many users

### 4. **Flexibility**
- Easy to add new data partitions
- Can support team/organization groups
- Future-proof architecture

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data
If you have existing data without proper `group_id`:
1. Shared knowledge should be updated to `group_id="0"`
2. User conversations should be updated with user's UUID
3. Can be done with Neo4j Cypher queries

### For New Deployments
1. Run document ingestion - automatically uses `group_id="0"`
2. User conversations automatically isolated by UUID
3. No additional configuration needed

## Monitoring and Verification

### Check User Isolation
```cypher
// Count episodes by group_id
MATCH (e:Episodic)
RETURN e.group_id, COUNT(e) as count
ORDER BY count DESC
```

### Verify Shared Knowledge
```cypher
// Check shared knowledge base
MATCH (e:Episodic {group_id: "0"})
RETURN COUNT(e) as shared_episodes
```

### Audit User Data
```cypher
// Check specific user's data
MATCH (e:Episodic {group_id: "USER_UUID_HERE"})
RETURN COUNT(e) as user_episodes
```

## Conclusion

The Neo4j user isolation is now fully implemented and tested. The solution leverages Graphiti's native `group_id` feature for clean, efficient, and secure data partitioning. Users' personal health conversations are completely isolated while maintaining access to shared medical knowledge.

**No further action required** - the system is ready for production use with proper user isolation.
