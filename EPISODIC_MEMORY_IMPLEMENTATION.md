# Episodic Memory Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive episodic memory system using Graphiti for the Medical RAG agent. The system creates episodic nodes and facts from every user interaction, enabling the agent to remember and learn from previous conversation sessions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Medical Entity Extraction
- **File:** `agent/medical_entities.py`
- Custom Pydantic models for medical domain entities
- Pattern-based extraction for:
  - Patient information (age, gender, medical history)
  - Symptoms (name, severity, location, duration)
  - Conditions and diagnoses
  - Treatments and medications
  - Test results and vitals

### 2. Fact Triple Generation
- **File:** `agent/fact_extractor.py`
- Extracts semantic relationships from conversations
- Pattern types:
  - Symptom patterns (HAS_SYMPTOM, SYMPTOM_LOCATION)
  - Severity patterns (HAS_SEVERITY with mild/moderate/severe/extreme)
  - Temporal patterns (DURATION, ONSET, FREQUENCY)
  - Causal patterns (CAUSES, TRIGGERED_BY, AGGRAVATES, RELIEVES)
- Confidence scoring and validation
- Fact consolidation to eliminate duplicates

### 3. Episodic Memory Service
- **File:** `agent/episodic_memory.py`
- Creates conversation episodes with:
  - Medical entity extraction
  - Fact triple generation
  - Symptom timeline tracking
  - Memory importance scoring
  - Batch processing with error handling
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Fallback storage for failed episodes

### 4. Graph Integration
- **File:** `agent/graph_utils.py`
- Enhanced GraphitiClient with:
  - Custom entity type support
  - Fact triple storage via `add_fact_triples` method
  - Episode creation with medical context
  - Temporal knowledge graph building

### 5. Database Schema
- **File:** `sql/combined_episodic_memory_migration_fixed.sql`
- PostgreSQL/Supabase tables:
  - `episodic_memories`: Core episode storage
  - `episodic_entities`: Extracted medical entities
  - `episodic_facts`: Fact triples with confidence scores
  - `symptom_timeline`: Temporal symptom tracking
- Vector embeddings limited to 1536 dimensions for Supabase compatibility

### 6. API Integration
- **File:** `agent/api.py`
- Background task management with:
  - Configurable timeouts (default 30s)
  - Global task tracking
  - Proper cleanup on shutdown
  - Asynchronous episode creation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Episodic Memory
EPISODIC_MEMORY_ENABLED=true
EPISODIC_MEMORY_TIMEOUT=30.0
EPISODIC_BATCH_SIZE=5
EPISODIC_FLUSH_INTERVAL=30
FACT_EXTRACTION_CONFIDENCE=0.7
MEMORY_IMPORTANCE_THRESHOLD=0.5

# Vector Dimensions (Supabase compatible)
VECTOR_DIMENSION=1536

# Embedding (maintains Gemini models)
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=gemini
EMBEDDING_MODEL=gemini-embedding-001
```

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Vector Dimension Compatibility
- Created truncation system for Gemini embeddings (3072 → 1536)
- File: `ingestion/embedding_truncator.py`
- Maintains Gemini models while fitting Supabase limits

### 2. ✅ Missing Method Implementation
- Implemented `add_fact_triples` method in GraphitiClient
- Properly stores fact relationships in knowledge graph

### 3. ✅ Regex Pattern Case Handling
- Fixed case-insensitive matching with `re.IGNORECASE`
- Temporal facts now correctly extracted regardless of text case

### 4. ✅ Safe Group Access
- Added bounds checking for regex match groups
- Prevents IndexError with incomplete pattern matches

### 5. ✅ Robust Error Handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback storage for failed episodes
- Proper timeout protection for background tasks

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. `test_fixes_simple.py` - Verification of all fixes
2. `test_episodic_local.py` - Local integration tests
3. `tests/episodic/test_episodic_memory.py` - Comprehensive test suite

### Test Results
✅ All tests passing:
- Regex case fix verified
- Safe group access verified
- Dead code removed successfully
- Batch error handling implemented
- Timeout implementation verified
- Medical fact extraction working
- Pattern-based extraction working
- Edge case handling working
- Confidence filtering working
- Fact consolidation working

## Usage Example

```python
from agent.episodic_memory import episodic_memory_service

# Automatically called during conversations
await episodic_memory_service.create_conversation_episode(
    session_id="session_123",
    user_message="I have severe headaches for 3 days",
    assistant_response="I understand you're experiencing severe headaches...",
    tools_used=[{"tool_name": "vector_search"}],
    metadata={"user_id": "user_456"}
)
```

## Deployment Status

### Ready for Production ✅
- All critical bugs fixed
- Comprehensive error handling in place
- Timeout protection implemented
- Fallback mechanisms working
- Tests passing

### Render Deployment
The system is ready for deployment on Render with:
- Proper environment variable configuration

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Monitoring & Metrics**
   - Track episodic memory creation success/failure rates
   - Monitor fact extraction accuracy
   - Dashboard for memory usage

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Automated retry of failed episodes from storage
   - Memory consolidation for long-term retention
   - Cross-session memory synthesis

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Rate limiting for memory creation
   - Batch optimization for large conversations
   - Cache frequently accessed memories

## Conclusion

The episodic memory system is fully implemented and tested. It successfully:
- Extracts medical entities and facts from conversations
- Creates temporal knowledge graphs with Graphiti
- Handles errors gracefully with retry and fallback mechanisms
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing RAG system
- Maintains compatibility with Supabase's vector dimension limits

The system is production-ready and deployed on Render.
