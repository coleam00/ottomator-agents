## What It Is
Fine-tuning embedding models adapts pre-trained models to domain-specific data, improving retrieval accuracy for specialized vocabularies and contexts. Instead of using generic embeddings trained on broad data, you train the model on your specific corpus with relevant query-document pairs. This teaches the model to recognize domain jargon, relationships, and semantic patterns unique to your use case.

## Simple Example
```python
# Prepare domain-specific training data
training_data = [
    ("What is EBITDA?", "positive_doc_about_EBITDA.txt"),
    ("Explain capital expenditure", "capex_explanation.txt"),
    # ... thousands of query-document pairs
]

# Load pre-trained model
base_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Fine-tune on domain data
fine_tuned_model = base_model.fit(
    train_data=training_data,
    epochs=3,
    loss=MultipleNegativesRankingLoss()
)

# Use fine-tuned model for retrieval
query_embedding = fine_tuned_model.encode("What is working capital?")
# Better matches domain-specific financial documents
```

## Pros
Significantly improves retrieval accuracy for specialized domains (5-10% gains typical). Can achieve better performance with smaller model sizes after fine-tuning.

## Cons
Requires domain-specific training data (query-document pairs or synthetic data). Additional time and resources needed for training and evaluation.

## When to Use It
Use when working with specialized domains (medical, legal, technical) with unique terminology. Ideal when retrieval accuracy is suboptimal with generic embeddings.

## When NOT to Use It
Avoid when working with general knowledge or common topics. Skip if you lack training data or can't afford the fine-tuning investment.
